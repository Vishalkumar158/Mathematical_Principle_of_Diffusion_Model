[**MIT Diffusion & Flow Models — Laboratory Implementations (2026)**](https://diffusion.csail.mit.edu/2026/index.html)

This repository contains my complete implementation of the lab assignments from the MIT course “Diffusion and Flow Models” (2026) offered at CSAIL. The course provides a rigorous mathematical and practical introduction to modern generative AI techniques, with a strong focus on:

- Diffusion Models

- Flow Matching Models

- Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)

- Fokker–Planck Equation

- Latent Generative Models

- Score-based Modelling & Denoising

These labs follow the course structure closely, translating the theoretical foundations into hands-on implementations.
